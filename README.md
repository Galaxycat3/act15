I chose the advanced search and filtering as well as bulk operations.

## Getting Started

1. Use Firebase or the app interface to add products.
2. Use the search bar to search products.
3. Use the pencil to update or change a product's name or price.
4. Use the checkbox to perform bulk operations such as deleting.
